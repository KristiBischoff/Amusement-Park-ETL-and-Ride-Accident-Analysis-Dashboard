## Amusement Park Database and Ride Accident Analysis

### Introduction

Amusement parks are known to be quite exhilarating and offer a vast amount of fun for families and people of all ages. Water parks, spinning rides, and rollercoasters are a few examples of what is found at some of these venues. Not everyone is a thrill seeker though, and certain rides may be avoided due to preferences. Additionally, throughout the years, there have been reports of accidents at amusement parks that have either led to fatalities or injuries. Notably, it has created a stigma for some people regardless of a plethora of safety precautions used at amusement parks. On the contrary, some folks are not phased and see these amusement park “accidents” as quite rare. 

While fatalities resulting from amusement park accidents are indeed quite rare, it does catch the attention of those who will be planning their trips in the near future. Staying informed and being mindful of ways to have a safe ride experience are advantages that the public may take.
